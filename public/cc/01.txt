00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.300
- Despite their presence and persistence in the workplace,

1
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.900
women are often paid and promoted

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.900
less than their male contemporaries.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.900
- This has to change, 

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and the organizations who get this right

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.000
have a competitive advantage. 

6
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.600
They can expect higher levels of innovation, 

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.000
employee satisfaction, and engagement. 

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.900
- Hello there, I'm Dr. Daisy Lovelace, 

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.900
and this is my friend and colleague, Dr. Carolyn Goerner. 

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
- We're business school professors, 

11
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.900
coaches, and consultants. 

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.900
We have expertise in leadership, communication, 

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.900
and human resource management. 

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Best practice in this area

15
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.900
demands a strategy for inclusive excellence,

16
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
which means fostering environments where women can thrive. 

17
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.900
- And research shows us that women are just as accomplished 

18
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.500
and aspire to similar goals as men do, 

19
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.900
yet we see few reaching the highest levels of leadership

20
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.300
in most fields.

21
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.000
- And that's something we need to talk about.

22
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.000
This course isn't about fixing women

23
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.900
or telling women to be more like men.

24
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.900
- [Daisy] In fact, we don't take a deficit view of women.

25
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.900
Women and men have different strengths.

26
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And by harnessing both,

27
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.900
organizations and their people can thrive.

27
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.900
- This course is for women

28
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.900
and the men who want to collaborate with them.

29
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.900
Join us as we explore

30
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
common experiences women in leadership face

31
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.000
and discuss strategies to address and overcome them.
