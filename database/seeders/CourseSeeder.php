Women leaders face different expectations, norms, and realitiesâ€”and are paid and promoted less. Creating an environment of "inclusive excellence," where both women and men can thrive, takes the right skills and strategy. This course is for anyone who wants to build a more equitable and collaborative culture at their organization, including women leaders and the men who work with them. Business professors, colleagues, and coaches Daisy L. Lovelace and Carolyn Goerner discuss the common challenges that women in leadership faceâ€”including gender bias, communication barriers, and imposter syndromeâ€”and introduce strategies to overcome them. Plus, get tips for championing women\'s leadership and becoming a strong ally.',
